- 👋 Hi, I’m @creativejvw
- 👀 I’m interested in both front-end development and back-end development using such tools as JavaScript, Python, and SQL as well as game APIs for educational purposes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about JavaScript, Python, SQL, Angular, and Ruby.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple educational games and applications.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Knowing HTML was a prerequisite for library school, but I became really interested in coding several years later while I was a special librarian and in charge of a team of student programmers at a university.
